Title: MovieApp (Pending)
Author: Shane Burkhart
Business Model: Freemium

Problem: 
I always see previews that make me want to see the movie but forget about the movie at some point.  By the time it's at Redbox or on Netflix, I never remember what it's about so I don't rent it.

Mission Statement: 
Let the user keep track of movies that are out or coming out and notify him/her so they will not let it slip by.  Notify when it comes to Redbox, and when it comes to theaters.

Goal: 
An app to persue on the side when I don't have anything else to work on.

Summary of Strategy: 
Use Flixter API to get movies, trailers, ratings, and new releases.  Start by making it for iPhone and then Android.  

Possible Features: 
-Use shazam on the trailers to add to your list.  
-Email user each week to tell them upcoming movies, movies they would like, and movies coming out on Redbox.
-Make it super easy to add and remove movies from list.
-Possible friends and user profile. For sharing.
-Give movie times at local theaters.
-Give locations at close Redboxes.

Models: 
User - email, provider, uid, password*, name
WatchList - user_id, flixter_id, rating (How bad they want to see it)

Controller:
Static - About, etc.
Users - resource
Movies - index, search, show
Watches - index, new, create, destroy
